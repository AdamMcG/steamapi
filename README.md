# steamapi
An open source React Project consuming the Steam API to leverage learning React. 

To use, build like so: 
1. Pull codebase
2. Start Nginx with "start nginx" - brain teaser, eh? 
3. "npm run build" to build the system for the server to serve. 

TBA - Quality of life scripts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
